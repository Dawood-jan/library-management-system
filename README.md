# Library Management System

This project is designed to streamline the process of managing a library online, replacing traditional manual methods. Users can browse available books and request to borrow them. Once a request is made, an admin will review and either approve or reject it. If approved, the user will receive an email notification confirming the book is ready for borrowing; if rejected, they will be notified as well.

## Usage

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Navigate to both the backend and frontend directories and install the required dependencies by running:

npm install

## Step 2: Start the Backend

Go to backend directory and start the server using:

npm start

## Step 3: Start the Frontend

Go to frontend directory and start the frontend server using:

npm run dev

## Step 4:

After starting the server, if you want to log in as an admin, you can find the admin credentials in the app.js file in the backend. If you want to sign up as a user, use a real Gmail account, as users will receive email notifications about book approvals, and other library updates.
